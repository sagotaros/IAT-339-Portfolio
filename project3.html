              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>This project is a seven weeks long design project for my interface design course in SIAT, in which I worked in a team of three through a process of research, proposal, and prototype to design an interactive user interface. We were provided with a weekly goal and critique evaluation from the teachers’ assistant of the course, this was an essential step as we were able to continuously improve our design accordingly. Not only was it challenging for us in the design aspect, it challenged us to work in a team setting through a period of time, keeping communication while avoiding hurdles along the way.

              <h2>Design Process</h2>
              <p>Our focus on an issue was the difficulties of planning a large-scale convention amidst the Covid pandemic, so we decided to design an app that is efficient and helpful for event administration teams to work simultaneously and effortlessly with in-person event staff in hopes to ensure that Covid regulations and restrictions are being followed so that both staff and guests are kept safe.<br>
              <h2>Ideation</h2>  
              <p>In coming up with the idea for Con-TACT, we were first tasked with designing an application targeting the new balance between in-person and online activities in a professional context. With all of our team members having an interest in anime, we came up with the idea of an anime convention planning application. We went with this idea as anime conventions have a large number of both in-person and online components that go into running them nowadays.

                Thus I had begun sketching rough layouts of what I thought the overall layout would look like before we started making an initial mockup. I had tried to make the design overall simple to navigate so the staff members wouldn’t have trouble looking for certain features.</p>

                <figcaption>Initial sketches of the overall mock up and rough layout of the features.</figcaption>
              </div>
              <h2>Persona</h2>
              <p>Following our initial design concept, we conducted research into the convention industry to see how we could best serve our desired audience. After collecting a list of different team roles and the tasks that they conduct to put together an event we narrowed our focus and designed two user personas. One focused primarily on the pre-event team of administration and management, while the other was based on event day members and volunteers. This two-pronged approach allowed up to view potential holes that our app could help fill.</p>

                <figcaption>Second Persona based on our intended user.</figcaption>
              </div>
              <h2>Initial Mockup</h2>
              <p>After getting a strong idea of what our application would be, we designed two different variations of the user interface. We used an anime-inspired colour scheme and easily readable fonts. I worked on the home page layout of the blue prototype using UXPin following closely my initial sketches while adding the colour scheme we had picked out. I added a drop-down menu so it is easier to keep track of upcoming and previous conventions. This stage required a lot of testing as it was my first time using UXPin, and I was not familiar with all the features that it had.</p>

                <figcaption>The colour palette we used for our application.</figcaption>
              </div>
              <p>Upon comparing both initial designs after the feedback from the professor, we decided to go with the red and green ones due to its better readability and overall more professional look.</p>

              </div>
              <h2>User Testing</h2>
              <p>To receive outside feedback on our application we conducted a user study with six participants. Four participants participated in person and two participants participated remotely. 

                For the study, we first introduced the concept and idea of the application to the participants. We then gave them a few minutes to explore and familiarize themselves with the application before having them complete two specific tasks. We interviewed the participants after each task and concluded each session by asking if they had any feedback on any other part of the application.</p>
                <h2>Logo Design</h2>
                <p>After we have finished implementing most of the features, I was on to my next task which was logo designing for our login page, a perfect spot to place a logo to further enhance the recognizability of our application. I had made initial designs on Clip Studio Paint based on what I think would make a clear and concise logo for our application. For the final logo, I implemented my teammates’ feedback as they suggested that I kept the logo simpler thus I removed the gradient colours and resorted to using only two colours.</p>

              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>Through months of constant feedback and changes, we were finally able to finish this project. This was my first time using UXPin and I’ve gained a lot of new insight from this project. We were overall happy with the end result as it capture the bubbly personality of the anime we liked to watch by using round shapes and bright fun colours overall. I would consider this a great success regardless of the grade I have received, as I have gained more experience in working smoothly in a team setting avoiding conflicts with my team members, as well as learning new software through this project. Furthermore, I learned to enhance my design process and found the importance of user tests to find issues within your design.</p>
