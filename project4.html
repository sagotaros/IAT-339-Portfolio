              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>This is the final group project for my Animations course in SIAT, in the whole semester we learned different techniques of modeling, rigging, texturing, and animating in Maya. This was a gradual process working up to the actual making of this short animation, making use of the skills we had learned during the lectures and labs. As a team, we brainstormed and ideated a story that took place in the ocean with the fishes discovering a treasure. We had to apply our animation skills to make this animation as lively as we can, and we took many inspirations from other animation studios and tried to learn and apply those concepts.

              <h2>Plot</h2>
              <p>The creature is swimming aimlessly around the ocean and then sees something shiny in the distance. He swims towards it and stumbles upon an abandoned, sunken ship. He begins to explore the mysterious ship and finds a treasure chest. He tries many ways to open it by tapping on it and head-butting it. He keeps trying and then it cuts to a wide shot where two other fish are swimming by and hears the loud noises. They decide to look and see what is happening and find the fish and the treasure chest. All three work together to open the chest and finally open it and there is a bright light.</p>
              <h2>Design Process</h2>
              <p>Our focus on an issue was the difficulties of planning a large-scale convention amidst the Covid pandemic, so we decided to design an app that is efficient and helpful for event administration teams to work simultaneously and effortlessly with in-person event staff in hopes to ensure that Covid regulations and restrictions are being followed so that both staff and guests are kept safe.<br>
              <h2>Ideation</h2>  
              <p>The team was formed and we began brainstorming concepts for the final project in a Google Document. We listed out potential characters, overall plotlines, and environments for each story and narrowed it down to one of the options. Collectively, as a team, we decided to go for a story that revolved around a fish as the main character. From there we looked into precedents to find inspiration for the overall art direction of our film. We also created our website to document our progress as we create this animation.  We populated our rough outline for our plot for the story and our description of the environment it will take place. Finally, we included our initial sketches of characters and objects we will be creating as well as the precedents we looked into for inspiration.</p>

              <h2>Animated GIF</h2>
              <p>I was tasked with creating a moving image for introducing the animation name as well as the ending screen, thus I started drawing in Procreate in order to create the 2D animation. My inspiration for this is from the Spongebob cartoon, as they often used bubble letters to introduce their episodes, thus I made it look somewhat transparent in color and popped at the end imitating a bubble. In order to make them move in a cartoonish vibe, I had to duplicate a few frames and then move to the next frame making it rather stop-motion aesthetic.</p>

              </div>
              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>This was a new experience as it is my first time creating an animation, however, it was a very memorable and interesting project that I have learned quite a lot about 3D modelling and rigging the characters. It is a project that is time-consuming but very fun to take part in, and I would like to take part in more animation projects in the future to improve upon this skill.</p>
