              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>This was one of the publication project that I worked on in which I learned to design an effective magazine—its
                brand, editorial content, and subscription collateral—for a distinctive audience and how
                to extend reach online. Principles of audience development, editorial direction, and art
                direction are emphasized through two written and four design projects.

              <h2>Magazine design rationale</h2>
              <p>
                  For the Orbit magazine I wanted something futuristic and technology related, thus for the cover
                  image I had picked out an image that gives off the metaverse vibe while relating to the word “orbit”
                  as the girl in the image is seemingly orbited by the metal pieces. For the tagline I had selected to be
                  “Unveiling the Future of Entertainment and Beyond” as this will be a magazine that will cover
                  different topics regarding technology within entertainment.</p>
              <p>
                    For the typography it is kept
                    minimalistic in order to make the cover not as clutter with text, and instead is focused mainly on
                    the attraction of the cover image. I had treated the image through Adobe Photoshop in order for
                    all of the typography to show clearly, that includes blurring, burning, rotating, and enlarging the
                    image. The title of this magazine is clearly seen to introduce us to the metaverse, I wanted to use
                    the colour contrast to make the “metaverse” pop out, and have used similar colours throughout the
                    cover to make everything seamless.
