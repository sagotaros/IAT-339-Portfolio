              <h2>Introduction</h2>
              <p>This was a web coding project that I worked on that focuses on the layout of the e-commerce site. For this website I focused on making the interface with a bright aesthetic as its main target audience being K-pop enjoyers who enjoys the bright and youthful aesthetic.

                  <h3>My Role</h3>
                  <p>Creating the style guide, worked on the home, products, product details, checkout, and payment pages of the website.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3>Tool</h3>
                  <p>GitHub, GitKraken, Visual Studio Code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)</p>

              <h2>Website design rationale</h2>
              <p>For this website, the main theme I wanted to focus on was the bright and fun colours that will appeal to the young audience as well as the products that I picked out were of the cuter aesthetic. The main colours of the website is pink and purple which perfectly captures the young, hip, and Y2K aesthetic I tried to go for.<br>
              <br>Since it is a shopping website, I wanted to make the overall navigation to be easy and smooth experience, thus all the buttons are straight forward and leads the users to the products right away.</p>
              <h2>Challenges</h2>  
              <p>The process of making the website accessible and adapt to both desktop and mobile platforms was quite the challenge as I haven't had a lot of web coding experiences prior to this project. Through searching for online tutorials and insights, I was able find specific solutions to my issue and made it more personalized by taking different elements of the tutorial and combining it to solve the issues with the use of media queries, flexboxes and creating specific mobile elements such as the menu and making the background image change depending on the screen size.</p>

              </div>
              <h2>Reflection</h2>
              <p>Overall it was an interesting project where I got to explore the process of brand creation and creating a website from scratch with the use of programming. It has gotten more interested in web development and would love to explore more ways to improve and integrate different methods to make the website experience more interesting. To improve for next time, I would have more detailed text for the website so the users wouldn't be confused, as well as making use of more web animation to make the website more interesting visually.</p>
